<h1>How much are you really earning per hour?</h1>
<h2>Are your clients really profitable?</h2>
<br>
<p>If you want to know if your hard work is really paying off,
    you can use this calculator!</p>
<p>For each project you have completed, please introduce the client's name, hours worked
    and amount billed (converted to EUR) in the form below.</p>
<p>After introducing the information, you will be sent to a summary with a registry of all your
    clients. You will be able to see the rate you are earning per hour for each client, as well
    as a stats summary.</p>
<p>You can introduce as many projects as you want. We encourage you to come back here
    everything you finish a new project to get updated information about your business.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> This page is a beta version. If you want to keep your data secure, please use
aliases instead of the real names of your clients.</p>
